Keyword: Word Embeddings
Definition: Word embeddings are vector representations of words in a continuous vector space, where semantically similar words are mapped closer together. They are commonly used in NLP tasks to capture the semantic meaning of words.
Example: If a user searches for "king", the word embeddings might return similar words like "queen", "monarch", or "prince".

Keyword: Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Definition: Named Entity Recognition is an NLP technique that identifies and classifies proper nouns in text, such as the names of people, organizations, locations, dates, and other entities.
Example: A search for "Barack Obama visited Paris" will identify "Barack Obama" as a person and "Paris" as a location.

Keyword: Tokenization
Definition: Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units, such as words, phrases, or symbols, which are then used as input for various NLP tasks.
Example: Given the sentence "Natural Language Processing is fun", tokenization will split it into ["Natural", "Language", "Processing", "is", "fun"].

Keyword: Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS Tagging)
Definition: POS Tagging is the process of labeling words in a text with their respective parts of speech, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.
Example: In the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", POS tagging identifies "fox" as a noun and "jumps" as a verb.
